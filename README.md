## Overview

PredictoBot is a bot made for the 2023 Discord DDevs Buildathon. It is designed to provide server owners, administrators
and community managers with powerful insights into their communities. With PredictoBot's machine learning capabilities,
PredictoBot can analyse chat data and predict emerging trends in the community, allowing owners to stay ahead of the
curve and foster more engaging, dynamic conversations.

## Technologies

### Node.js and Discord.js

- **Node.js**: PredictoBot's core is built on Node.js. It powers the bot's functionality, allowing it to interact with
  Discord servers and users.
- **Discord.js**: We use the Discord.js library to create and manage the Discord bot. It provides the necessary tools
  for connecting to Discord servers, monitoring chat activity, and responding to user commands.

### Python and Flask

- **Python**: The Python programming language is used for the bot's machine learning capabilities and the backend
  API.
- **Flask**: Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, and it's used to create the backend API. Flask exposes
  endpoints that the Discord bot communicates with to request trend predictions and insights.
