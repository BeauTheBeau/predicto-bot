# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy outlines how PredictoBot handles and safeguards your data. PredictoBot is committed to protecting
your privacy and ensuring that your data is used responsibly and securely. By using PredictoBot, you consent to the data
collection and practices described in this policy.

## Data Collection

PredictoBot collects the following data from servers it is a part of:

- **Messages** PredictoBot logs messages sent in channels it has access to, which includes the message content, author,
  channel, server, and timestamp. It does not collect messages from channels it doesn't have access to.
- **Server and Channel Metadata** PredictoBot gathers information about the servers and channels it operates in.
- **User Metadata** PredictoBot collects data related to users, which may include usernames, IDs, or other relevant user
  information.

## Opting Out

PredictoBot is an opt-in service, which means that server owners must explicitly invite PredictoBot to their server for
it to start collecting data. As a server owner, you have the option to opt out at any time by removing PredictoBot from
your server. **Additionally, as a user,** you can opt out by executing the `/optout` command in any channel where
PredictoBot has access. Your data will be promptly removed from our database upon receiving the `/optout` command, 
alternatively, see [Contact Us](#contact-us). PredictoBot will also automatically delete a server's data if it is
removed from the server after 7 days, but you can request that your data be removed immediately by contacting us or 
executing the `/guilddelete` command in any channel where PredictoBot has access (owner only).

## Data Usage

PredictoBot is committed to safeguarding your data and ensuring that it is not used for any purpose other than providing
its insights. Specifically:

- **No Data Sharing** PredictoBot does not sell or share your data with any third parties. Your data is kept
  confidential and is not disclosed to external entities.
- **No Data for Training** PredictoBot does not use your data to train machine learning models. Your data is exclusively
  utilized to enhance the PredictoBot service and provide insightful responses to your queries.
